## 🔧 C++ Final Operator Overloading

This **C++ program** demonstrates advanced **operator overloading** using custom classes `Whole` and `Decimal`. The program supports various operations such as arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators. It also showcases user input and output functionalities, utilizing custom printing functions and the ability to handle boolean logic.

## ✨ Features  
- ➕ **Addition (`+`)**: Overloaded to perform addition on `Whole` and `Decimal` types.  
- ➖ **Subtraction (`-`)**: Overloaded to perform subtraction on `Whole` and `Decimal` types.  
- ✖️ **Multiplication (`*`)**: Overloaded to perform multiplication on `Whole` and `Decimal` types.  
- ➗ **Division (`/`)**: Overloaded to perform division on `Whole` and `Decimal` types.  
- 🧮 **Equality (`==`)**: Compares two `Whole` or `Decimal` objects for equality.  
- 🔲 **Logical AND (`&&`)**: Performs logical AND operation between `Whole` or `Decimal` types.  
- 🔳 **Logical OR (`||`)**: Performs logical OR operation between `Whole` or `Decimal` types.  
- 🖥️ **User Input and Output**: Handles user input for `Decimal` values and prints the results of operations.  
- 💡 **Custom Printing Function**: Utilizes `yoi::print` and `yoi::printer` for formatted output.
